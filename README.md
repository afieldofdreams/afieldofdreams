## Hi, I’m Adam 👋

I build technology and research systems that help organisations make better decisions under uncertainty.

I’m the founder of **[Wild Griffin](https://wildgriffin.com)** — a platform focused on translating environmental and systemic research into decision-ready tools. My work sits across applied research, AI, systems thinking, and real-world risk.

This GitHub is where I explore ideas, prototypes, and infrastructure that support that work.

## What I’m working on

**Wild Griffin**
- Research translation pipelines that turn evidence into usable decision inputs
- Data models designed for uncertainty, not false precision
- Applied AI systems with humans kept accountable
- New incentive models for applied research and evidence contribution

The goal isn’t better reporting.  
It’s better decisions.

## Background

I’ve spent the last decade working on high-stakes systems across healthcare, legal, and financial domains.

- Product and AI leadership in regulated environments  
- Design and delivery of decision support systems under real constraints  
- Former commercial pilot, trained in structured decision-making and risk management  

Those principles now shape how I design technology and research workflows.

## Projects

A selection of current and evolving work.

- **Wild Griffin Core**  
  Research ingestion, synthesis, and decision-support tooling for environmental risk

- **Decision Frameworks**  
  Lightweight tools and templates for reasoning under uncertainty

- **Applied AI Experiments**  
  Human-in-the-loop systems for evidence extraction, summarisation, and trade-off analysis

- **Research Infrastructure**  
  Data models and pipelines for applied, decision-oriented research

(Most work here is early, opinionated, and evolving.)

## How I think

- Data is only useful if it changes a decision  
- Uncertainty should be exposed, not hidden  
- Systems fail because of incentives, not ignorance  
- “We don’t know yet” is often the most honest output  

## Collaboration

I’m interested in working with people focused on applied research, environmental risk, policy-adjacent technology, and high-stakes decision systems.
